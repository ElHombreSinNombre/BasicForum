# Basic Forum

This exercise can use to see how works a forum in **PHP v7**. We can use **PDO** (PHP Data Objects) or **mySQLi** to create and modify database. We recommend use PDO but in this case we use mysqli. **MySQL** was removed in PHP v7.

We use **[Boostrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)** in frontend.
